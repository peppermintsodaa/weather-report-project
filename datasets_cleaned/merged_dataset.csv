CAT063,Cyclone Larry,2006-03-17,2006-03-21,QLD,"Severe tropical Cyclone Larry crossed the tropical north Queensland coast near Innisfail during the morning of 20 March 2006. Between Babinda and Tully, damage to infrastructure and crops was extensive, with the total estimated loss upwards of half a billion dollars. In north-west Queensland, heavy rainfall from the cyclone caused several townships to be isolated for a number of days and, as a result, food drops were required and emergency supplies had to be delivered by helicopter. The banana industry in the region was almost wiped out, losing about 200,000 tonnes of fruit, worth about $300 million, representing approximately 80 percent of Australia's banana crop. The storm also destroyed at least $15 million worth of avocados. The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2006 damage at $540 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $609 million.",FNQ,cyclone,2006,540000000.0,914800000.0,30674.0,Cyclone Larry,Queensland,Cairns,Cyclone,2006-03-20,2006-03-20,2006,540000000.0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
