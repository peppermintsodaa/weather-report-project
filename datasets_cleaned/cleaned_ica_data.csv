On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February. In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends. Flights out of the region were fully booked. The hospital's 300 patients were evacuated to Brisbane and other regional hospitals by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other means of transportation.  This was an unprecedented evacuation effort. The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone’s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars found metres away from where they were left and boats piled on top of each other in some regions. Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville. The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million loss to agricultural production in Queensland, particularly the banana and sugarcane sector. The Federal Government processed more than $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink.

CAT905,Northern NSw and SW QLD Flooding,1990-04-18,1990-04-21,NSW QLD,"On 18 April 1990 after several weeks of heavy rain over Queensland, a strong upper level low dumped upwards of 150 mm of rain with exceptional totals to 350 mm across large areas of central Queensland over a three day period. Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away. On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter. The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents’ attempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 metres, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away. The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period. Major flooding occurred on the Thomson, Avon and Mitchell Rivers. Hectares of vegetable crops were destroyed by flood waters and highways cut. People were evacuated from low-lying areas. It total 150 homes were flooded. Property losses from the three-state flood were considerable.  Towns and houses were flooded, infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, thousands of sheep and cattle drowned and thousands of hectares of crops were ruined.

The system intensified over the Gulf and attained cyclone strength by 0000 UTC 25 February 1979. The track of the system after 0000 UTC 25 February 1979 is depicted below. The cyclone crossed the coast 30 km north-northwest of Bing Bong homestead at 0400 UTC 26 February 1979 with an estimated central pressure of 955 hPa, the lowest pressure during its life cycle.

Undeclared,Cyclone KERRY,1979-02-12,1979-03-06,QLD,"Kerry was a remarkable tropical cyclone having a long life-span and erratic track. It is also notorious for being only one of two cyclones in the Australian region to have an airplane (a US NOAA research aircraft) fly into the cyclone (the other being TC Rosa ). Indeed a wind speed of 252 km/h measured by this aircraft at an altitude of 540 m was at that time one of the strongest low-level winds measured in a cyclone in the Australian area. Kerry 's origin is linked to a low that became evident near 5S, 170E on 7 February 1979. By 10 February 1979 some cyclonic curvature could be detected in the surrounding convective cloud field. Three days later the system was displaying consistent organisation. The subsequent erratic track is shown below. Kerry intensified steadily while moving west-southwest at 15 to 35 km/h and by 15 February 1979 was classified as a severe tropical cyclone. As Kerry crossed the Solomon Islands maximum observed winds were 72 km/h at about 70 km south of the cyclone, however widespread destruction and loss of life were experienced near the centre, indicating the existence of much stronger winds. Estimated winds from satellite data were 125 to 145 km/h. After moving away from the Solomon Islands on a southwesterly track, Kerry again intensified steadily. Maximum intensity was attained on 19 February 1979 and Kerry then slowly weakened while moving towards landfall on 1 March 1979. Kerry moved erratically around a large loop from 19 to 26 February 1979 crossing its own track at least three times. A factor in the decay after 19 February was the intrusion of dry sub-tropical air that moved around the west and northwest of the cyclone. This is a common feature of decaying cyclones in the Australian region. Aircraft reconnaissance flights on 21 and 22 February 1979 and satellite imagery together show evidence of this dry air and suppressed convection in these quadrants. As Kerry approached the coast across the Whitsunday Islands radar surveillance showed a weak vortex with a ragged and poorly defined eye, but winds of over 108 km/h were observed. Kerry moved west-northwest over land for just over a day then moved northward back over the Coral Sea. The cyclone began to re-intensify east of Townsville late on 2 March 1979. This re-intensification continued while the cyclone moved northward to be east of Cairns on 3 March. Later that day Kerry came under the influence of strong northwesterly winds ahead of an appraoching large amplitude upper-level trough and accelerated to the southeast, weakened and decayed over the ocean on 6 March 1979. Although Kerry was a severe cyclone while well offshore, it had weakened considerably by the time it made landfall and only minor wind damage occurred in some coastal centres and offshore resorts.Nevertheless, boats collectively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars were damaged or destroyed in Mackay harbour on 1 March 1979.

During the next few days the weak, complex low, which remained after Peter , migrated slowly westwards across the southeast and southern Gulf. By late on 7 January 1979 satellite photographs indicated a weak circulation. The system exhibited an erratic course to the northeast of Groote Eylandt and did not intensify until it began to move in an east-northeasterly direction after 2000 UTC 8 January 1979. The path of the low continued in an east-northeasterly direction, with gradual deepending to cyclone intensity and acceleration as it crossed the Gulf. Ship reports at 2100 UTC 9 January 1979 indicated 68 km/h winds 270 km north-northwest of the centre and near 68 km/h winds 100 km to the east-northeast.

Satellite imagery during 6 January 1979 showed a clearly discernible circular eye and the cyclone was at its most intense. Gordon moved south-southwest towards New Caledonia until 7 January When it gradually turned to a more westerly track. Throughout 7 and 8 January 1979 satellite photographs indicated a marked weakening of the system. Reports from ships in the area and offshore automatic weather stations indicated winds generally from 55 to 70 km/h with one report of 83 km/h from Frederick Reef early on 10 January 1979. Throughout 10 January Gordon continued to weaken and lost all tropical cyclone characteristics: it continued to move westward, however, as a tropical low.
